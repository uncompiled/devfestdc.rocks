    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <i>Last Updated: 08-Sep-2015</i>
    <p>GDG-DC is a community-organized Meetup intended for networking and collaboration in the community.</p>
    <p>We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout all Meetup events.</p>
    <p>To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any GDG-DC event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout events.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h1>The Short Version</h1>
    <p>GDG-DC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Meetup participants in any form.</p>
    <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Meetup venue, including talks.</p>
    <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</p>
    <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the Meetup without a refund at the sole discretion of the Meetup organizers.</p>
    <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h1>The Longer Version</h1>
    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, persistent following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Further unacceptable behavior will result in escalating sanctions.</p>
    <p>Exhibitors and sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors and sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.</p>
    <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, try to make amends and move forward.</p>
    <p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the Meetup with no refund, or legal action.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h1>Contact Information</h1>
    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Meetup organizer. Meetup organizers can be found on the Organizers page of the Meetup.com site.</p>
